<p>Godzilla was a fictional charater created in the 1950's. He began his life as just an ordinary lizard until the nuclear bomb was dropped on his home Hiroshima, which turned him into the radioactive monster everyone knows and loves to this day!<p>
<p> Godzilla got its popularity in Japan where the movie was created and was brought to the United States the very next year.</p>
<p>The science fiction movie was an instant hit and the rest is history in the making.</p>
<p>Later on, the writers of the movie decided to add in more of the giant monsters know as kaiju.</p>
