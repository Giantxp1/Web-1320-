<h2>Everything Else About Me Page</h2>
<img src="About.jpeg" Alt="about">
<p>I'm a Graphic Designer from Chattanooga, Tennessee. Since I was little I've always been fascinated by Art. I've always like Artist such as Salvador Dali and T-shirt Designer Dan Mumford.<p>
<p> I really enjoy hobbies such as gaming, art,skateboarding, and messing with technology.</p>
<p>I hope to give people a new style that not only involes skating but art too! </p>
